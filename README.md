# Building-a-spam-filter-for-text-messages
Mobile phone spam also known as (unsolicited messages, especially advertising),
directed at the text messaging or other communications services of mobile phones
or smartphones. Fighting SMS spam is complicated by several factors (compared
to Internet email), including the lower rate of SMS spam, which has allowed many
users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of
mobile phone spam-filtering software.
In this lab, weâ€™ll be looking at a text classification problem using python where we
sort spam messages from ham.

Steps: 
1. Prepare train and test datasets


2. Text pre-processing


3. Feature extraction:
There are various feature-extraction techniques that can be applied on text data:



a) Bag of Words Model



b) TF-IDF Model





4. Model training and prediction (Classification)







5. Model evaluation
